    "story_text": "The Lincoln Memorial stands as a testament to American history and values. Designed by architect Henry Bacon, this neoclassical monument honors the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. The memorial was part of the McMillan Plan, which expanded upon L'Enfant's original vision for Washington, D.C. When completed in 1922, it quickly became one of the most visited sites in the nation's capital. Its purpose was to commemorate Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War and his commitment to preserving the Union. The memorial, with its 36 columns representing the states at the time of Lincoln's presidency, creates a solemn and reflective atmosphere for visitors. The McMillan Commission's vision transformed the National Mall into what we see today. Washington, D.C. has evolved into a city of monuments and memorials that tell America's story. The commission's urban planning concepts have influenced city development across the country. The thoughtful design of public spaces continues to be studied and appreciated worldwide. Urban planning teaches us that well-designed public spaces can strengthen community bonds. Just as the McMillan Commission carefully considered the placement of monuments and open spaces, we can think about how our own communities are designed. Are there gathering places where people can come together? Do we have spaces that honor our shared history? These elements of urban design can make our neighborhoods more connected and meaningful. So, remember the McMillan Commission, whose expanded vision helped create the iconic National Mall we know today. Their work shows us that thoughtful planning can create spaces that inspire and unite communities for generations. Perhaps someday you'll help design spaces that bring people together in your own community!",

    "story_text": "Venus, often called Earth's sister planet, has some fascinating characteristics. It rotates on its axis very slowly, with one day on Venus lasting about 243 Earth days - much longer than Earth's 24-hour day. Interestingly, Venus rotates in the opposite direction compared to most planets. A year on Venus, the time it takes to orbit the sun, is shorter than its day, lasting about 225 Earth days. Unlike Mars and Earth, Venus doesn't have distinct seasons because its axis has very little tilt. Venus is extremely hot, with temperatures that can melt lead. Its thick atmosphere traps heat, creating a runaway greenhouse effect. Scientists study Venus using special spacecraft that can withstand its harsh conditions. These missions help us understand the planet's volcanic activity and its unusual atmosphere. By exploring Venus, researchers hope to learn more about climate change and planetary evolution. Venus remains a captivating world that helps us appreciate the diversity of planets in our solar system!",

    "story_text": "Hello! I'm Zoe Maria Chen, but everyone just calls me Zoe. I'm eight years old. I live with Mom, Papa, and my older brother, Leo. Uncle and auntie live in our apartment complex, too. My two closest friends, Tiana and Jackson, also live here. My family and I used to live in a big house in the suburbs. Now we live in a city with busy streets and many shops. Join me on my exciting city adventures! \"Can I help make dinner tonight?\" Zoe asked Mom one Sunday evening. Zoe and her family lived in an apartment building. They had a small kitchen, not like their old house's spacious one. Everyone had to take turns using the kitchen counter space. \"Of course,\" Mom answered. \"We'll add cooking to your responsibility chart. Papa can help Leo with his homework. He has a math test tomorrow.\" \"That works for me,\" Papa said. He sat down with Leo at the dining table. \"Now I have three responsibilities,\" Zoe said. \"Feeding our cat Milo, watering the plants, and helping with dinner.\" Zoe helped Mom gather ingredients from the refrigerator. She washed her hands at the sink. In the kitchen, Mom divided the vegetables into groups. \"Chop each vegetable into small pieces,\" she instructed Zoe. \"Each dish needs different sized pieces.\" \"I understand!\" Zoe replied.",
